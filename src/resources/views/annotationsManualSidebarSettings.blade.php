<h4><a name="export-area"></a>Export Area</h4>

<p>
    The export area can be used to restrict generated reports to a specific area of the images of a volume. Click <i class="fa fa-pencil-alt"></i> edit to draw or edit the export area. The area can be drawn similar to a <a href="{{route('manual-tutorials', ['annotations', 'creating-annotations'])}}#rectangle">rectangle annotation</a> and will be permanently displayed on all images of the volume. If a report is set to be restricted to the export area, only annotations inside this area will be considered. Delete the export area with the <i class="fa fa-trash"></i> delete button. Set the export area opacity to 0 to hide it.
